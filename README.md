# LibraryOrganizer_OOP

Hello there! 
You are here to see a project I`ve made as a student at Sela College on OOP principals. 

Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism are all came together to make a library organiser (I have a problem of generating normal names for projects).

The app is a catalog of books and journals, both of these classes inherit from an abstract item. They both have shared and individual properties.

The app is euqipped wit a power of storing and filtering every kind of data you possibly can. There is an instant search by any property of a book or a journal you ask for. Instantly shows a data on any given object you select from list. Create and delete items, get comfy UI, that is all you need, to manage a library. 

Tech: WPF, C#, OOP
